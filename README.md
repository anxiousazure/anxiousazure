Greetings from the Xianzhou Luofu! I'm still stuck here chewing at the lore.

You can call me Azure, Az, Anxious... I answer to most things, including whichever character my avatar is!

I am an adult, so - I don't know, be warned? What do I even say here...

I use he/they/it pronouns mainly, but if you wanna use some of the neos I hoard, check out [HERE](https://en.pronouns.page/@anxiousazure)

Always feel free to interact I promise I'm more scared of you than you are of me most times,,,

Okay, I should... Talk about interests, right? That's a thing people do.

Uh.

Oh no.

If it wasn't obvious I really like Honkai Star Rail! Several of the characters live rent free in my head, hehe.

I'm super fixated on the Xianzhou Alliance lore but also Amphoreus has me in a chokehold so. Please please please I wanna talk about it. Chatter to me please.

I also really really like Subnautica, it's probably one of my favorite games of all time. I also log a completely reasonable (it is not at all reasonable) amount of hours in Stardew Valley!

Also also!! I have. recently. gotten into Cookie Run Kingdom. Which initially was supposed to be just a fun little idle game for me. And then I got invested in the lore of the cookie game. So. Uh. Smiles. Whoops???

Other things about me...

Oh!

I really like to write in my free time, I'm especially fond of character creation. Please ask about my OCs or tell me about yours.

I also draw on occasion and sometimes dabble in nail art.

I have memory issues so if I'm talking about the same thing over and over. I am so sorry I do not remember.

Anyways. please check out my rentry it's also got my mad rambles and information.
